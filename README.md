# schoolprojects

This is a collect of old projects from my days at the College of William and Mary.  
I've uploaded these to demonstrate some core competencies and show off some projects I completed at school.

In the folder CS415, some highlights include:

Project 4 - a networked game called "nim" built using TCP/IP Sockets in a client/server model
Project 5 - a simulation of beetles using shell scripting
Project 7 - a networked game of tictactoe using TCP/IP Sockets and tcl libraries to create graphical representations
